# AirPure-Market-Research-Dashboard

This is a Resume Challenge Project - 16 organised by Codebasics and Sponsored By Dataful.

# Company Overview:
AirPure Innovations is an early-stage startup developing an air purifier for the Indian market. While the company recognizes the severe air quality crisis in India's top 14 most polluted cities, it requires a robust market analysis to validate the existence of a strong, sustained consumer demand before committing to a full-scale product launch.

# Project Overview:

This project analyzes real-world Indian datasets, including Air Quality Index (AQI), health outcomes, population trends, and EV adoption, to identify high-priority markets for a new air purifier. The resulting strategy provides data-backed recommendations for an effective product, pricing, and market entry plan tailored to the Indian consumer.

üîë Key Focus Areas
1.Target critical pollutants causing major health risks.

2.Define essential air purifier features for users.

3.Identify high-demand cities and estimate market size.

4.Align R&D with region-specific pollution patterns.

Tools stack used:-
1. Excel - Datasets

2.Power Bi- data visualisation and data modeling, data cleaning

3.Canva - Presentation

## üß† Key Insights:

Worst Areas with AQI - Delhi,Patna,Surat Bengaluru,Pune
Behaviour Shift in Consumer purchase  - During Post- diwali and winter season when the pollution is at its worst level.
Awareness among people - in Urban Areas
Policies -  NCAP  - Drop in PM10 pollutant in 131 cities, 
                    EV Promotion (FAME - II) in cites like Delhi, Pune, Benguluru has AQI improved.
Health Impact - Children aged (6 -11 yrs) are most affected , 



# Recommendations:-
